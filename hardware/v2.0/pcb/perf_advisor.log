Ratsnest schedule check
-------------------------------
* VCC20 net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* VCC5-ADC net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* GND net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* VDD3.3-ADC net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* VBAT net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* VDD3.3 net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* VDD3.3-ETH net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* VCC-5 net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".
* VCC5 net has VOLTAGE property, but the ratsnest schedule is is NOT
  "POWER_AND_GROUND".

DRC checks
----------------------
* OK.

Constraint region check
-------------------------------
* The constraint regions RGN and RGN overlapped. Suggest fixing the overlap.
  ISSUE: Constraint regions that overlap require significantly more processing
          to solve.

    Intersection point of shapes listed below:	(1173.000, 1733.000)
      shape/region location:  (1173.000 2185.000)
      layer:                  CONSTRAINT REGION/TOP
      shape/region location:  (251.000 1733.000)
      layer:                  CONSTRAINT REGION/TOP


Dynamic shape check
-------------------------------
* OK.

Sector table check
-------------------------------
* The ratio of design extent to route keepin extent is too large (86.537324).
  Suggest reducing design extent.

Constraint set check
---------------------------------
* Unused csets list (2):
  ISSUE: Design maintenance issue, slight performance impact.

    SCS:	POWER
    SCS:	AN


NODRC_SYM_SAME_PIN check
---------------------------------
* OK.

Cross section check for bad dielectric constant values
--------------------------------------------------------
* OK.

Padstack size check
----------------------
* OK.

Conductor line check
------------------------------
* OK.
